  <h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
    <p>I have a great interest in matters technology,
      which highly influenced my study in the field of Engineering.
      I am a Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering graduate
      from The University of Nairobi. I have experience in
      Engineering Designs using CAD software. Regarding employment,
      I currently do not have experience since I am UoN's Class of 2017
      graduate, and I opted to further my studies after graduation.
    </p><br>As mentioned previously, I am tech fun, and this motivated
      my decision to learn programming. I believe that the combination of
      my Mechanical Engineering skills with that of programming will
      enable me automate machines. Additionally, I will be able to create
      apps that would be used to control industrial machines and
      equipments. </br>

    <p>Despite my strong focus on the tech industry, I also have fun in life.
      I enjoy travelling, swimming, and sunset-walks. </br>
