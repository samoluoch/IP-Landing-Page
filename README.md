##Project set-up: The project involved the creation of the project directory and initiating git inside the directory using the terminal. The index.html file was created togther with the css folder and styles.css file inside the main directory. Atom was then initiated and html codes written as well as css codes. Git commits were done several and the files pushed to the master branch. The gh-pages branch was then craeted and further commits and push done.
